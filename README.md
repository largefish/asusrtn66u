# asusrtn66u
asusrtn66u.py is a Python class that can be used to emulate user interaction with the web interface of an Asus RT-N66U router. It uses the Selenium Python library which you can read more about at https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/. 

This was only written to do a couple very specific things on the router. There are methods to log in, log out, reboot, and change VPN endpoints. Feel free to add more functionality to the class as needed. There is an example Python script in the repo that demonstrated how I use this code and might gve you an idea for some other things to try.
